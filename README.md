# MacBook Configuration

This repository contains the current configuration for my MacBook. It is intended to document the themes, plugins, and tools I use to set up and personalize my development environment.

## Purpose

The main goal of this project is to serve as a reference for my setup, making it easy to restore or replicate my environment on a new machine. The configurations include:

- Homebrew package list (Brewfile)
- Terminal themes and settings
- Editor and IDE configurations
- Plugins and extensions
- System preferences and customizations
- Dotfiles and setup scripts

## Getting Started

### Install Homebrew Packages

First, make sure you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed. Then run:

```bash
brew bundle install
```

This will install all the packages, applications, and fonts listed in the `Brewfile`.

## Note

Some configurations are tailored to my personal workflow and hardware. Adjust them as needed for your own use.
